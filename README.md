# Image-Based-Traffic-Sign-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
This project develops a deep learning model for traffic sign classification using the GTSRB dataset. The goal is to build a robust model that classifies traffic signs into 43 categories, aiding autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, and driver assistance systems in recognizing and interpreting traffic signs.
